# McHacks2021

This project was created for McHacks8 


An attempt is being made

We want to develop an algorithm to combat misinformation in social media and provide accurate, evidence-based fact checking to help readers determine the trustworthiness of information they encounter on social media. Given some of our backgrounds in health sciences, we want to primarily focus on health-related misinformation.
